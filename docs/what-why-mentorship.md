# The what and why of mentorship

## What is mentorship?

If you ask people to define "mentorship," you will most likely receive wide-ranging responses.

To some, mentorship is a formal activity involving a schedule and agenda. To others, mentorship is an informal process among peers. It can even be a one-time conversation. It's a spectrum of personal preferences.

> Mentorship means different things to different people, depending on their situation, context, culture, and more.

That is what makes mentorship such an important and powerful concept: it is both universal and personal. It’s universal insofar as it has potential to be a positive experience for anyone, yet personal insofar as it occurs differently for every individual and in every relationship.

Therefore, one way of thinking of mentorship is the following:

> Mentorship is an act, experience, and opportunity to share what you can, when you can, how you can.

## Why is mentorship important?

### 👤 It helps you

Mentorship is an act, experience, and opportunity to share what you can, when you can, how you can.

Mentoring can be a personally rewarding experience. The help and guidance you share can have valuable, lasting benefits. For example:

- Experience the positive emotions of giving back
- Learn more about yourself
- Find knowledge gaps in your own thinking

- Learn something new

- Expand your world view

- Make a new friend, ally, or supporter

- And more!

Hearing others stories and perspectives, makes your own that much more richer, dynamic, and inclusive.

### 👥 It helps others

> “To the world you may be one person, but to one person, you may be the world” \(Dr Seuss\)

Mentorship helps those navigating different stages of their careers or different life circumstances. Whether it's personally, academically, professionally, and at different stages: starting out, growth, and beyond.

It has the potential for positive and lasting impact (big and small, yet valuable just the same).

### 🌍 It helps the broader community and world

> "A candle loses nothing by lighting another candle" \(James Keller\)

What we put in, we get out. Collectively, we can do our part in fostering a more inclusive, collaborative, and innovative community.

We are raising the waters so that we're all uplifted. It's a ripple effect. We help someone and they help someone and it continues.

Before you know it, it's like a boomerang of help that returns to you.
